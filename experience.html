   The Science Bowl experience begins very early on a  Saturday morning in November. 
        First you will arrive at USJ at 7:30 A.M.
        You should bring a calculator, bring $10 for lunch money,sleep early the day before the Science Bowl,and eat a good breakfast.
        You will meet Mrs. Ramer and Mrs. Daniel in the parking lot of the upper/middle school office. You will get on the bus once everyone has arrived we will depart for UT Martin. 
        The ride is approximately 1 hour and 6 minutes. 
        On the way we practice by answering questions.
        Mrs. Ramer ask  us biology questions and Mrs.Daniel ask us chemistry questions. 
        Once we arrive at UT Martin we will find the room we are testing in and we go and take our test. 
        The test time is 2 hours,but you will probably finish before then. 
        Once the supervisors giving test say we can leave we do. 
        After the test we usually go to a classroom where professors show us a presentation about biology,chemistry,or physics.
        Next we take a group picture. Later we go and eat lunch off campus. 
        When  we finish eating lunch we go back  to the campus and await the test results. 
        Once the results come the top four scorers will represent our school in the bowl round. 
        The bowl round consists of as many questions that can be asked in twenty minutes.
        The first question is a toss up and whichever team  gets it right gets to  choose which category they want to asked. 
        At the end of  the twenty minutes whichever team has the highest score wins the round.       
        Whichever team wins the most rounds wins the the Science Bowl.
        After the bowl round the four science bowl participants get medals. 
        Usually we leave if we lose early. 
        We usually arrive back at USJ around 4:30 p.m. 
        It is truly a great experience.
