        <h3>About</h3>
        <p> High schools are invited to send teams to the 2015 Science Bowl, Nov. 14, at the University of Tennessee at Martin. There is no registration fee, but teams should be registered by Nov. 1 to participate.
          The event is sponsored by the university’s chapter of the Student Members of the American Chemical Society with assistance from the newly-created Northwest Tennessee Regional STEM Hub. The Hub serves schools in Benton, Carroll, Crockett, Decatur, Dyer, Gibson, Henry, Lake, Lauderdale, Obion, Tipton and Weakley counties and will provide teacher stipends, bus travel and a mini-workshop on dye-sensitized solar cells while students participate in the written exam.

          Competition will begin with a written test covering topics in biology, chemistry and general science with 25 questions in each category. There is no limit on the number of entries accepted from each school. 

Eight schools will be chosen for the afternoon quiz bowl competition based on scores from the written exam. Four of these slots will be reserved for schools from STEM Hub counties. Selection is based on the average total scores of each school’s two highest-ranking students. Competition rules will be similar to those of “The G.E. College Bowl,” a television quiz show originally aired from 1958-1970.

Champion and runner-up schools will each receive trophies, and team members will receive medallions based on their final scores. Each participating school will also receive a copy of the Merck Index, an internationally-recognized handbook of chemical, pharmaceutical and biomedical information. </p>
